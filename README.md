## Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

## Overview

This repository, **DataStructuresAlgorithm**, is dedicated to the practice and implementation of key **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **JavaScript**. The purpose is to provide a clear understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, with working examples and problem-solving practice.

## Folder Structure

- `HashTables/`  
  Contains implementations and examples of hash tables, including methods for collision resolution, insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

- `Linked lists/`  
  Focuses on singly and doubly linked lists, including insertion, deletion, traversal, and other common operations.

- `Stacks and Queues/`  
  Contains implementations of stacks and queues, covering operations like push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, and additional examples.

- `arrays/`  
  Includes algorithms and challenges related to arrays, such as searching, sorting, and manipulation techniques.

- `.DS_Store`  
  A system file, can be ignored or removed.
